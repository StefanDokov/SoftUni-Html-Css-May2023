                Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions.
                Small minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a
                feeling that you can become great too.

                Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of
                self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the
                best of which you are capable.

              Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision.
              The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward
              organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common
              people to attain uncommon results. Individual commitment to a
              group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company work, a
              society work, a civilisation work.
